The app I developed aimed to simplify weight tracking, addressing the need for a user-friendly tool to set and monitor weight goals. Key user requirements included easy data entry, progress visualization, and reminder notifications. 
To meet these needs, I designed screens for user login, weight entry, settings management, and editing. I created an intuitive user interface by using simple forms, large buttons, and clear instructions to minimize user confusion. These designs prioritized user flow, task completion, and visual clarity.
During coding, I employed modular design principles by breaking the app into smaller, manageable parts. I also conducted frequent testing to identify and resolve issues. These strategies can be applied in the future to enhance efficiency and debugging ease.
I thoroughly tested my code through input validation and ensuring user actions triggered the intended responses. 
Testing is crucial for verifying the appâ€™s functionality and enhancing the user experience. I particularly excelled in demonstrating my proficiency in the login and design of a simple application that was user friendly. 
This showcased my ability to effectively balance functionality and user experience design.
